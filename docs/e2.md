## E2 API

### Creating An E2 Client
The `github.com/onosproject/onos-ric-sdk-go/pkg/e2` provides clients and high-level interfaces for interacting
with E2 nodes. To create an E2 client:

```go
import "github.com/onosproject/onos-ric-sdk-go/pkg/e2"


...
config :=  e2.Config{
      AppID: app.ID(appID),
      E2TService: e2client.ServiceConfig{
          Host: "onos-e2t",
          Port: 5150,
     },
      SubscriptionService: e2client.ServiceConfig{
           Host: "onos-e2sub",
           Port: 5150,
     },
} 

client, err := e2.NewClient(config)
if err != nil {
    ...
}
```

### E2 Subscription API
To subscribe to receive indications from an E2 node, first define the subscription:

```go
import "github.com/onosproject/onos-api/go/onos/e2sub/subscription"

...

var eventTrigger []byte // Encode the service model specific event trigger

details := subscription.SubscriptionDetails{
    E2NodeID: subscription.E2NodeID(nodeID),
    ServiceModel: subscription.ServiceModel{
    	Name: "oran-e2sm-kpm",
    	Version: "v1"
    },
    EventTrigger: subscription.EventTrigger{
        Payload: subscription.Payload{
            Encoding: subscription.Encoding_ENCODING_PROTO,
            Data:     eventTrigger,
        },
    },
    Actions: []subscription.Action{
        {
            ID:   100,
            Type: subscription.ActionType_ACTION_TYPE_REPORT,
            SubsequentAction: &subscription.SubsequentAction{
                Type:       subscription.SubsequentActionType_SUBSEQUENT_ACTION_TYPE_CONTINUE,
                TimeToWait: subscription.TimeToWait_TIME_TO_WAIT_ZERO,
            },
        },
    },
}
```

Subscriptions support service model data definitions for event triggers and actions encoded in Protobuf or ASN.1.

Once the subscription is defined, use the `Subscribe` method to register the subscription and beging receiving indications. Indications are received in a Go channel:

```go
import "github.com/onosproject/onos-ric-sdk-go/pkg/e2/indication"

ch := make(chan indication.Indication)
_, err := client.Subscribe(context.TODO(), details, ch)

for ind := range ch {
    ...
}
```

The `Subscribe` method will return once the subscription has been registered with the subscription service. Once a subscription has been registered, it will not be unregistered until explicitly requested by the client. Changes to the state of the E2 node, subscription service, and termination points will be handled transparently by the core services and client implementation, which will work continuously to receive indications on the given channel.

A `context.Context` can be used to set a timeout for the subscription initialization:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)
defer cancel()
_, err := client.Subscribe(ctx, details, ch)
```

If the `Subscribe` call is successful, a `subcription.Context` will be returned. The context can be used to terminate the subscription by calling the `Close()` method:

```go
// Open the subscription
sub, err := client.Subscribe(context.Background(), details, ch)
...
// Close the subscription
err = sub.Close()
```

The `Close()` method will return once the subscription has been removed from the E2 Subscription service. The indications channel
will be closed once the subscription has been closed,
so it's safe to read from the indications channel in an indefinite loop.

In addition, subscription API is equipped with an error channel to receive errors that 
happens during processing of a subscription request in E2T or E2 node. For example, to read 
errors from the error channel:

```go
for err := range sub.Err() { 
	// handle and log errors 
}
```

### E2 Control API
Control API providing the capability of sending E2 control messages to the E2 node via E2T and 
receiving E2 control acknowledgement and failure messages. 

To use control API, the following package should be imported in your go code
```go
e2tapi "github.com/onosproject/onos-api/go/onos/e2t/e2"
````


To create a control request using SDK, the following 
items should be specified in the request:

- E2 node ID
- Encoding type (e.g. Protobuf or ASN.1)
- Service model name and version 
- Request to receive Control Ack, Control Nack, or No ack
- Service model specific control header bytes
- Service model specific control message bytes


For example,

```go
request := &e2tapi.ControlRequest{
		E2NodeID: e2tapi.E2NodeID(nodeID),
		Header: &e2tapi.RequestHeader{
			EncodingType: e2tapi.EncodingType_PROTO,
			ServiceModel: &e2tapi.ServiceModel{
				Name:    "oran-e2sm-rc-pre",
				Version: "v1",
			},
		},
		ControlAckRequest: e2tapi.ControlAckRequest_ACK,
		ControlHeader:     ControlHeaderBytes,
		ControlMessage:    ControlMessageBytes,
	}

```

After creating the request, you can call Control function to send the request
to the E2T to be processed and sent to the corresponding E2 node as follows:

```go
response, err := e2Client.Control(ctx, request)
```

To get acknowledgement and failure from the response message: 

```go
ack := response.GetControlAcknowledge()
failure := response.GetControlFailure()
```

ack and failure messages have `ControlOutcome` field that can be retrieved and 
decoded for a service model.
